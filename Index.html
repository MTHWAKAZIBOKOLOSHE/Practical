   <h2> What is Lorem Ipsum?</h2> 
    <p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and type
        setting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's sta
        ndard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown p
        rinter took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a t
        ype specimen book. It has survived not only five centurie
        s, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remain
        ing essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 19
        60s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem
         Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishin
         g software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of L
         orem Ipsum.</p>
    
    
    <h2>Why do we use it?</h2>
    <p>It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the re
        adable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using
         Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letter
         s, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look lik
         e readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page edit
         ors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for
          'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Var
          ious versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, some
          times on purpose (injected humour and the like).</p>
    
    
   <h2>Where does it come from?</h2> 
    <p>Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It ha
        s roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it 
        over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-
        Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin wor
        ds, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cite
        s of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable sour
        ce. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus
         Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, writt
         en in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very pop
         ular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem i
         psum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.</p>
    
    The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact original form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham.
    

    <h2>Where can I get some?</h2>
    <p>There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the 
        majority have suffered alteration in some form, by injected humour, or 
        randomised words which don't look even slightly believable. If you are 
        going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't 
        anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. All the Lorem Ipsum
         generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessa
         ry, making this the first true generator on the Internet. It uses a dic
         tionary of over 200 Latin words, combined with a handful of model sent
         ence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable. The g
         enerated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free from repetition, inject
         ed humour, or non-characteristic words etc.</p>
